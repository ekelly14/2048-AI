# 2048-AI
A few algorithms to intelligently solve the game 2048. Projects for artificial intelligence class.

The game is slightly modified in order to make it deterministic.
1. Start state will be specified
2. tile spawning pattern will be predetermined rather than random

Each branch contains a different algorithm I implemented to solve 2048. Each run on the same core framework I have written.
1. breadth-first - Breadth First Tree Search
2. ID-DTFS - Iterative Deepening, Depth First Tree Search
3. GreedyBestFirst - Greedy Best First Search
4. AStar - A* Graph Search
